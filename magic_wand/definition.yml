benchmark:
description: Floiting point version of TensorFlow Lite model that classifies gestures based on accelerometer data.
  Three magic gestures were chosen, and data were collected from 7 different people.
  Some random long movement sequences were collected and divided into shorter pieces,
  which made up "negative" data along with some other automatically generated random data.
  The dataset can be downloaded from https://download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/magic_wand/data.tar.gz
